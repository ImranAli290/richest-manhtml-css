<h1>Amazon</h1>
<p>
In late 1993, Bezos decided to start an online bookstore.[30] He left his job at D. E. Shaw and founded Amazon in his garage on July 5, 1994, after writing up its business plan on a trip from New York to Seattle.[31][32] Bezos named his new company "Amazon" after the Amazon River in South America, in part because the name begins with the letter "A," which is at the beginning of the alphabet.[33] He accepted an estimated $300,000 from his parents and invested in Amazon.[32] Although Amazon was originally an online bookstore, Bezos had always planned to expand to other products.[29][33] Three years after Bezos founded Amazon, he moved to take it public with an initial public offering (IPO).[34] He warned many investors that there was a 70% chance of failure, but the investors should have ignored his warning.[35] In response to critical reports from Fortune and Barron's, Bezos maintained that the growth of the Internet would overtake market competition from larger retailers such as Borders and Barnes & Noble.[33]

In 1998, Bezos advocated for enterprise diversification by initiating the sale of music and video, and expanded to include a variety of consumer goods by the end of the year.[33] Bezos used the $54 million raised during the company's equity offering to finance aggressive acquisition of smaller or competing firms.[33]
In 2002, Bezos led Amazon to launch Amazon Web Services, which compiled data from weather channels and website traffic.[33] During late 2002, rapid spending from Amazon caused it financial distress after revenues stagnated.[36] Bezos borrowed $2 billion from select banks with only $350 million in holdings.[37] After the company nearly went bankrupt, he closed distribution centers and laid off 14% of the Amazon workforce.[37] In 2003, Amazon rebounded from financial instability and turned a profit of $400 million.[38] In November 2007, Bezos launched the Amazon Kindle.[39] According to a 2008 Time profile, Bezos wished to create the same flow state found in video game simulations in books; he wished readers would fully engage with books.[40] In 2013, Bezos secured a $600 million dollar contract with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) on behalf of Amazon Web Services.[41] In October that year, Amazon was named as the largest online shopping retailer in the world.[42]
On Saturday, August 15, 2015, The New York Times published an article that described Amazon's business practices.[43] Bezos responded to his employees with a Sunday memo,[44] in which he rebutted the article's inferences that the company was an emotionally destitute workplace. Bezos said that anyone who believed that the story was true should contact him directly.[45] In May 2016, Bezos sold slightly more than one million shares of his holdings in the company for $671 million, making it the largest amount of money he had ever raised in a sale of his Amazon holdings.[46]
On August 4, 2016, Bezos sold another million of his shares at a value of $756.7 million.[47] A year later, Bezos took on 130,000 new employess when he initiated widespread hiring sprees across company distribution centers.[48] On January 19, 2018, his holdings in Amazon stock appreciated to slightly over $109 billion, when he began to sell stock to raise cash for other enterprises, in particular, Blue Origin. On January 29, 2018, he was featured in Amazon's Super Bowl commercial.[49] On February 1, 2018, Amazon reported its highest ever profit with quarterly earnings of $2 billion. Due to the proliferation of Alibaba in China, Bezos has continuously expressed interest in expanding Amazon across India.[50]
In March 2018, Bezos dispatched Amit Agarwal, Amazon's point person, to the country, with $5.5 billion to localize operations throughout their supply chain routes.[51] Later in the month, U.S. President Donald Trump accused Amazon�and Bezos in particular�of sales tax avoidance, misusing postal routes, and anti-competitive business practices.[52]Amazon's share price fell by 9% in response to the president's negative comments; this reduced Bezos' personal wealth by $10.7 billion.[53] Weeks later, Bezos recuperated his paper losses when academic reports out of Stanford University indicated that Trump could do little to meaningfully regulate Amazon in the near-to-long term future.[54]
<h2>Blue Origin</h2>

In September 2000, Bezos founded Blue Origin, a human spaceflight startup company.[55] Bezos has long expressed an interest in space travel, and the development of human life in the solar system.[22] Upon graduating high school, his valedictorian speech was covered by a 1982 Miami Herald interview wherein he expressed an interest in build and develop hotels, amusement parks and colonies for human beings in orbit.[56] The 18-year-old Bezos stated that he wanted to preserve Earth from overuse through resource depletion.[57]
After its founding, Blue Origin maintained a low profile until 2006, when it purchas a large tract of land in West Texas for a launch and test facility.[58] After the company entered the public's attention during the late 2000s, Bezos additionally indicated his interest in reducing the cost of space travel for humans while also increasing the safety of extraterrestrial travel.[59] In September 2011, one of the company's unmanned prototype vehicles crashed during a short-hop test flight. Although the crash was viewed as a set back, news outlets noted how far the company went from its founding-to-date in advancing spaceflight.[56] In May 2013, Bezos met with Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin Galactic, in 2013 to discuss commercial spaceflight opportunities and strategies.[60] He has been compared to Branson and Elon Musk as all three are billionaires who prioritize spaceflight among their business interests.[61]
In 2015, Bezos announced that a new orbital launch vehicle was under development and would make its first flight in the late-2010s.[62]Later in November, Blue Origin's New Shepard space vehicle successfully rocketed into space and reached its planned test altitude of 329,839 feet (100.5 kilometers) before executing a vertical landing back at the launch site in West Texas. In 2016, Bezos allowed select journalists to visit, tour, and photograph his facility.[63] He has repeatedly called for increased inter-space energy and industrial manufacturing to decrease the negative costs associated with business-related pollution.[64]
In December 2017, New Shepard successfully flew and landed dummy passengers, amending and pushing its human space travel start date into late 2018.[65] To execute this program, Blue Origin built six of the vehicles to support all phases of testing and operations: no-passenger test flights, flights with test passengers, and commercial-passenger weekly operations.[66] In late-2017, Bezos announced that he hoped to colonize the solar system, and sold $1 billion in Amazon stock.[67][68]
<h2>The Washington Post</h2>
<p>
On August 5, 2013, Bezos announced his purchase of The Washington Post for $250 million in cash.[69] In order to execute the sale, Bezos established Nash Holdings, a limited liability holding company that legally owns the paper.[70] The sale closed on October 1, 2013, and Nash Holdings took control.[71] In March 2014, Bezos made his first significant change at The Washington Post and lifted the online paywall for subscribers of a number of U.S. local newspapers in Texas, Hawaii, and Minnesota.[72] In January 2016, Bezos set out to reinvent the paper as a media and technology company by reconstructing its digital media, mobile platforms, and analytics software.[73] Throughout the early years of ownership, Bezos was accused of having a a potential conflict of interest with the paper.[74] Accusations of Bezos unfairly controlling the paper's content have been dismissed by Bezos and its editorial board.[75][76] After a surge in online readership in 2016, the paper was profitable for the first time since Bezos' 2013 purchase.[76]

<h2>Bezos Expeditions</h2>
<p>
Jeff Bezos makes personal investments through his venture capital vehicle, Bezos Expeditions.[77] He was one of the first shareholders in Google, when he invested $250,000 in 1998. That $250,000 investment resulted in 3.3 million shares of Google stock, worth about $3.1 billion in 2017.[78][79] He also invested in Unity Biotechnology, a life-extension research firm hoping to slow or stop the process of aging.[80] Bezos is involved in the healthcare sector, which includes investments in Unity Biotechnology, Grail, Juno Therapeutics, and ZocDoc.[81] In January 2018, an announcement was made concerning Bezos' role within a new, unnamed healthcare company. This venture is expected to be a partnership between Amazon, JPMorgan, and Berkshire Hathaway.[82][83]

Nellie Bowles of The New York Times has described the public persona and personality of Jeff Bezos as that of "a brilliant but mysterious and coldblooded corporate titan".[84] During the 1990s, Bezos earned a reputation for relentlessly pushing Amazon forward, often at the expense of public charity and social welfare.[84][85] His doing so projected a public image of prudence and parsimony with his own wealth and that of Amazon's. As a multi-billionaire, Bezos hung his clothes on a rack in his Amazon headquarters office and drove a 1996 Honda Accord.[86] Throughout the early 2000s, he was perceived to be geeky or nerdy, often wearing ill-fitting clothing and making a variety of social missteps.[87][88][89]
Bezos was seen by the public as needlessly quantitative and data-driven.[90][91] This perception was detailed by Alan Deutschman who described him as "talking in lists" and "[enumerating] the criteria, in order of importance, for every decision he has made."[87] Select accounts of his persona have drawn controversy and public attention. Notably, journalist Brad Stonewrote an unauthorized book that described Bezos as a demanding boss as well as hyper-competitive.[85][90] Studies involving former Amazon employees have noted interactions with Bezos as Darwinian in nature but praised the dynamic for maintaining a well-run company.[92] Bezos has been stereotyped as a notoriously opportunistic, operating with little concern for obstacles and externalities.[93][94] This depiction has been challenged by Bezos himself, his wife, Amazon employees, and the public as a mischaracterization.[95]
During the early 2010s, Bezos solidified his reputation for imperialistic business practices, and his public image began to shift. Bezos started to wear tailored clothing; he weight trained, pursued a regimented diet and began to freely spend his money.[96] His physical transformation has been compared to the transformation of Amazon; he is often referred to as the metonym of the company.[97][98] His physical appearance increased the public's perception of him as a symbolically dominant figure in business and in popular culture, wherein he has been parodied as an enterprising super villain.[99][100][101] Bezos eats exotic foods, such as breakfast octopus and roasted iguana.[102][103][104] During the late 2010s, Bezos reversed his reputation for being reluctant to spend money on non-business related expenses.[105] His liberal personal spending and lack of philanthropy drew a negative response from the public from 2016 to 2018.[106][105]
<h2>Personal Life </h2>
<p>When Bezos was working for D. E. Shaw in Manhattan 1992, he met novelist MacKenzie Tuttle. MacKenzie was a research associate at the firm and they married a year later.[29][154] In 1994, they moved across the country to Seattle, Washington, where Bezos founded Amazon.[155] He and his wife are the parents of four children: three sons, and one daughter adopted from China.[57][156]
In March 2003, Bezos was one of three passengers in a helicopter that crashed in West Texas after the craft's tail boom hit a tree.[157] Bezos sustained minor injuries and was discharged from a local hospital the same day.[24]
In 2016, Bezos played a Starfleet official in the movie Star Trek Beyond, and joined the cast and crew at a San Diego Comic-Con screening.[158]
