<b>Bernard Jean Etienne Arnault</b> (French; born 5 March 1949) is a French business magnate, an investor, and an art collector.[3][4]
Arnault is the chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of LVMH, the world's largest luxury-goods company. He is the richest person in France and the fourth richest person in the world according to Forbes magazine, with a net worth of 75.5 billion dollar, as of March 2018.In April 2018, he also became the richest person in fashion toppling of Zara Amancio Ortega.
<h2><u>Early Life</u></h2>
<p>
After graduating from the Lycee Maxence Van Der Meersch in Roubaix, Arnault was admitted to the Ecole Polytechnique in Palaiseau, from which he graduated with an engineering degree in 1971.
His father, Jean Leon Arnault, a graduate of Ecole Centrale Paris, was a manufacturer and the owner of the civil engineeringcompany, Ferret-Savinel.

<h2><u>LVMH</u></h2>
<p>
In 1987, shortly after the creation of LVMH, the brand new luxury group resulting from the merger between two companies, Arnault mediated a conflict between Alain Chevalier, Moet Hennessy's CEO, and Henri Racamier, president of Louis Vuitton. The new into Dior Couture.
In July 1988, Arnault provided 1.5 billion dollar to form a holding company with Guinness that held 24 per of LVMH's shares. In response to rumors that the Louis Vuitton group was buying LVMH's stock to form a blocking minority, Arnault spent 600 million dollar to buy 13.5 per more of LVMH, making him LVMH's first shareholder. In January 1989, he spent another 500 million dollar to gain control a total of 43.5 per of LVMH and 35 per of voting rights, thus reaching the blocking minority that he needed to stop the dismantlement of the LVMH group. On 13 January 1989, he was unanimously elected chairman of the executive management board.
Since then, Arnault led the company through an ambitious development plan, transforming it into one of the largest luxury groups in the world, alongside Swiss luxury giant Richemont and French based Kering. In eleven years, the market value of LVMH has multiplied by at least fifteen, while, simultaneously, the sales and profit rose by 500 per. He promoted decisions towards decentralizing of the group brands. As a result of these measures, the brands are now viewed as independent firms with their own history.
Arnault professional decisions support the idea that LVMH has shared advantages such having the strong brands that help finance those that are still developing. The portfolio of major luxury brands has a history of stability, and thus its solidity allows for new acquisitions and group development. It is because of this strategy that Christian Lacroix could open his own fashion house.
In July 1988, Arnault acquired Celine. In 1993, LVMH acquired Berluti and Kenzo. In the same year, Arnault bought out the French economic newspaper La Tribune. The company never achieved the desired success, despite his 150 million euro investment, and he sold it in November 2007 in order to buy a different French economic newspaper, Les Echos, for 240 million euros.
In 1994, LVMH acquired the perfume firm Guerlain. In 1996, Arnault bought out Loewe, followed by Marc Jacobs and Sephora in 1997. These brands were also integrated into the group Thomas Pink in 1999, Emilio Pucci in 2000 and Fendi, DKNY and La Samaritaine in 2001.
In the 1990s, Arnault decided to develop a centre in New York to manage of LVMH presence in the United States. He chose Christian de Portzamparc to supervise this project. The result was the LVMH Tower that opened in December 1999.
